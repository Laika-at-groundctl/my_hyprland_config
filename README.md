# welcome to my hyprland config

this is a collection of diffrent configs I've taken from others and tweaked to my prefrences. 

I have not altered any of the orignal configs notes and messages and have tried to add comments where applicable.

## notes

1. this is just for a bit of fun. I'm not to serious about updating it but feel free to request changes
2. the install script assumes you use arch or a arch distrobution. I have not built it for other distros but everything (minus the install script) should work regardless
3. this config uses the JetBrains Mono and JetBrains Mono nerd font because it is what I like. it should be relatively easy to swap out if you feel like it.

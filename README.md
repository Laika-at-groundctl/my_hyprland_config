# welcome to my hyprland config

this is a collection of diffrent configs I've taken from others and tweaked to my prefrences. 

I have not altered any of the orignal configs notes and messages and have tried to add comments where applicable.

## notes

1. there is an automated install scrit coming. in the meantime just copy all the files to your ~/.config directory
2. this is just for a bit of fun. I'll try update when I can/have made major changes but in the meantime just enjoy what you have
3. this config also assumes you use arch or a arch distrobution. I have not and will not build it specifically for other distros but everything (minus the install script) should work regardless
4. this config uses the JetBrains Mono and JetBrains Mono nerd font because it is what I like. it should be relatively easy to swap out but make sure you have a nerd font installed as certian things will not work without one
